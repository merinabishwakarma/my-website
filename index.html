            <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my personal website. I am <strong>Merina/Ganga</strong> from Nepal. I am a young individual interested in the mysteries of life. My life has taken me to many ups and downs; I come from a low-middle-class family where we have to work constantly to sustain ourselves.</p>

            <p>Since my father’s accident, he has been in a coma and bedridden. He needs constant nursing care—feeding, cleaning, and checking. It takes at least two individuals, me and my mom. My brother is in a foreign land working hard to support us. We struggle as any normal family does; we grind to invest in our dreams financially and mentally while finding peace in what we have.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I am not looking for sympathy, but this is the truth. In this reality, my family finds reasons to wake up, show up, and smile. I find strength here."
            </blockquote>

            <p>I see many people complaining, comparing, and getting frustrated. I am an empath. I stay humble. I believe we will reach where we are supposed to reach. I learned this from my father’s accident. He was the kindest man I ever knew. Life doesn't care who is good or bad, but that doesn't mean you take the bad side. We can all choose to be kind.</p>

            <p>In the past, I was more carefree. I learned dancing, won <strong>Miss Bishwakarma</strong> and <strong>Miss Damak 1st Runner-up</strong>, and was involved in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hunatemovement" target="_blank">The Hunate Movement</a> (formerly The Joon Project). But for the last 3 years, I have not left my father's bed. Sometimes I feel I am 'late' in life when I see friends on social media, but I repurpose my thoughts. Life will fix everything if you learn to stay happy and positive.</p>

            <p>I started my business, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meryels.pinchofstyle/" target="_blank">Merry El's</a>, and I am thankful to everyone who helped with my father's treatment. I have also started the <strong>RAW TALK</strong> podcast with my friend <strong>Khem</strong>, founder of the Hunate Movement. Khem is a man of immense wisdom who helped me overcome my mental habits and find my purpose. You can learn more from him at <a href="https://khemrajpradhan.com.np/" target="_blank">khemrajpradhan.com.np</a>.</p>
