    <h3>The Mystery & The Hustle</h3>
    <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my personal website. I am <strong>Merina/Ganga</strong> from Nepal. I am a young individual deeply interested in the wonders and mysteries of life, a journey that has taken me through many intense ups and downs. I come from a lower-middle-class family where we have always had to work constantly just to keep things moving forward.</p>

    <p>Since my father’s hit-and-run accident, everything has changed. He has been in a coma and bedridden for around three years now, requiring constant care, feeding, cleaning, and nursing. It takes at least two individuals, me and my mom, working around the clock to sustain him. Meanwhile, my smaller brother is in a foreign land, working incredibly hard to support our family. The workload is heavy, and like any normal family in our position, we struggle with the weight of loans and the constant grind. Every day is a mission to ensure we sustain ourselves while finding peace and happiness in the life we have right now.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "I strongly hope you do not take this as complaining, crying, or looking for sympathy. This is my truth. In this reality, my family and I find peace, happiness, and reasons to wake up, smile, and look toward the future."
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Choosing Kindness Over Complaint</h3>
    <p>I see many people complaining about life, comparing themselves to others, or getting frustrated because they feel they don’t have enough. As an empath, I feel these things deeply, but I try never to harm anyone or complain. I stay humble. I believe we will reach exactly where we are supposed to reach when the time comes.</p>
    
    <p>I learned this directly from my father’s accident. He was the kindest man I have ever known, yet life gave him and our whole family this situation, struggle we call it usually. But it taught me that life does not care who is "good" or "bad", life just happens. It is what MAYA of life means, may be. Rather than complaining, its wise to understand it. We can all still choose to be kind, loving, and caring in this beautiful life.</p>

    <h3>From The Stage to the Bedside</h3>
    <p>In the past, when my whole family was healthy and together, I was more carefree. My family supported me so much that I was able to fly. I learned dancing and fashion, and won beauty pageants like <strong>Purwanchal Miss Bishwakarma</strong> and <strong>Miss Damak 1st Runner-up</strong>. I was choreographing, teaching dance in schools, and being invited as a judge for pageants. I was also involved in a social research project called <strong>The Joon Project</strong> (now renamed the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hunatemovement" target="_blank">Hunate Movement</a>), researching social systems and natural laws to restructure failing systems. Life felt limitless.</p>

    <p>But for the past three years, I have not left my father's bedside. Sometimes I feel I am "late" in life. I see my friends on social media getting married, traveling, or chasing careers, and I feel as if I am in a punishment. I cannot meet friends or chase events like I used to. But despite these doubts, I do my best. I tell life it is okay.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Life happens as it has to; all we must do is work for ourselves, our family, our community, nature, and the future. Share what we have in excess, see beauty in all things, ask help if needed, and stay positive, life will give what we need and ask for gradually if we learn to stay positive and humble."
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Growth Through Struggle</h3>
    <p>I have learned so much in these years. I started my business, <strong>Merry El's - Pinch Of Style</strong>, an online 18K gold-plated jewelry store. I started content creation to share my journey, and I received so much help from people around the world for my father’s treatment. I am eternally grateful to everyone who donated. Because of your kindness, we were able to take him to India, Siliguri, and Delhi.</p>
    
    <p>This kindness fuels me. It reminds me to be a better version of myself and to be a person capable of helping others in need. I have learned that no one's pain is inherently bigger than another's, struggle is often a matter of perspective. Some take it as a reason for anger and destruction, but I take it as a reason to grow, actually i think everyone has to think this way too.</p>

    <h3>A New Chapter: RAW TALK & Hunate</h3>
    <p>Right now, while I am grounded at home, I am learning yoga, meditation, MMA, swimming, sewing, weaving, and gardening. I want to share this journey to inspire someone out there. I have also started the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@merinabishwakarma" target="_blank">RAW TALK</a></strong> youtube podcast with my friend <strong>Khem</strong>, the founder of the Hunate Movement. He is a man of immense knowledge and wisdom who helped me find my purpose.</p>
    
    <p>Khem is an extraordinary man with a vast range of insights—from ancient knowledge like Ayurveda and Permaculture to modern science and technology. He can lead teams, build ethical businesses, and solve complex problems with limited resources. He has helped me overcome my mental habits and find my ethical path. I encourage you to connect with him at <a href="https://khemrajpradhan.com.np/" target="_blank">khemrajpradhan.com.np</a> if you are seeking help or a new direction in life.</p>
