        <section class="story-container">
            <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my personal website. I am <strong>Merina/Ganga</strong> from Nepal. I am a young individual deeply interested in the wonders & mysteries of life, a journey that has taken me through many intense ups and downs. I come from a low-middle-class family where we have always had to work constantly just to keep things running.</p>

            <p>since my father’s hit and run accident, everything changed. He has been in a coma and bedridden for around three years now, requiring constant care, feeding, cleaning, and nursing. It takes at least two individuals, me and my mom, working around the clock to sustain him. Meanwhile, my brother is in a foreign land, working incredibly hard to earn and support our family. The workload is heavy, and like any normal low-middle-class family, we struggle with the weight of loans and the constant grind. We have to think and plan so much just to invest in our dreams, financially, mentally, and through our connections. Every day is a mission to ensure we sustain ourselves and find peace and happiness in the life we have right now.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I am not complaining, crying, sad or looking for sympathy, but this is the truth. In this truth and reality, I together with my family find peace, happiness, reasons to wake up, reasons to smile and look into future."
            </blockquote>

            <p>I see many people complaining about life, comparing themselves to others, or getting frustrated because they feel they don’t have enough. As an empath, I feel these things deeply, but I try never to harm anyone or complain. I stay humble. I believe we will reach exactly where we are supposed to reach in life as time comes. I learned this directly from my father’s accident. He was the kindest man I have ever known, yet life gave him and our whole family this situation. It taught me that life does not care who is "good" or "bad," life just happenes, but that doesn't mean we have to choose a bad path. We can all choose to be kind, loving, and caring in this beautiful life. Regardless of the mental and physical struggle, I still live, travel, explore, and grab every chance to build my business and help others.</p>

            <p>In the past, when my whole family was healthy and together, I was more carefree. My family supported me so much that I was able to fly. I learned dancing, fashion, and won beauty pageants like <strong>Purwanchal Miss Bishwakarma</strong> and <strong>Miss Damak 1st Runner-up</strong>. I was choreographing in many beauty pageants and teaching dance in schools, invited as Judge in beauty pagents, doing well in life. I was also involved in a social research and development project, <strong>The Joon Project</strong> (now renamed as) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hunatemovement" target="_blank">Hunate Movement</a>), researching social systems, nature, and humanity to restructure failing systems using science, ancient wisdom and natural laws. We worked with international individuals and orphanages, and life felt limitless.</p>
           
            <p>But since my father’s accident, I have not left his bedside. I have been his primary caretaker 24/7 for three years. Sometimes I feel I am "late" in life. I see my friends on social media getting married, traveling, or chasing jobs, and I feel like I am in a punishment. I can’t meet friends or chase events like I used to. But despite these doubts, I do my best. I tell life it is okay. I remember my parents' words "life happens as it has to, all we must do is work for our self, family, community, nature, and the future." They taught me to share what I have in excess and see beauty in all things. Life is beautiful if you learn to stay positive.</p>
           
            <p>I have learned so much in these years. I started my business <strong>Mery El's - Pinch Of Style</strong>, online 18K Gold Plated Jewelry store, I started content creation to share my story and journey, and I received so much help from people around the world for my father’s treatment. I am eternally grateful to everyone who donated. Because of your kindness, we were able to take him to India, Siliguri, and Delhi. This kindness fuels me. It reminds me to be a better version of myself every day. It wakes me up early, pushes me to care for my own health, and drives me to create better educational content and a business that can help others in need. This reminds me every day to be able person to help people in need everyday with what every i have. I have learned that, No one's pain is bigger than another's, struggle is often a perspective. Some take it as a reason for anger, frustration, distruction but I take it as a reason to grow.</p>
         
            <p>Right now, as I am grounded at home, at same time, I am learning yoga, meditation, MMA, swimming, writing journals, sewing, weaving, cooking, gardening, making pickles and everything i can do staying close to my family and father. I want to share this journey to inspire someone out there. I have also started the <strong>RAW TALK</strong> podcast with my friend <strong>Khem</strong>, the founder of Hunate Movement, a man of immense knowledge and wisdom, who helped me find my purpose. You can learn more from him at <a href="https://khemrajpradhan.com.np/" target="_blank">khemrajpradhan.com.np</a>. </p>
            
            <p>He is an extraordinary man with a vast range of unconventional insights, knowledge and skills of life, from ancient knowledge like Yoga, Meditation, Ayurveda, Permaculture Farm Design, philosophy to modern science, computer, and technologies. He can lead teams, build ethical businesses, build house with hands, furnitures, work with electricity, human body, nature, solve any possible problemes with limited resources. He has helped me overcome my situations, mindsets and find my ethical path. He helps people find their purpose without any flashy branding or ads, and I encourage you to connect with him if you need any help in life.</p>
